# IS452 final

To run this code, firstly I would recommend user to install Anaconda and PyCharm. And user can follow the link https://github.com/elliewix/IS-452-Fall2017/blob/master/installation_directions.md to finish the installation. Secondly, user needs to install pygame module by using the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). Just open the terminal, type “-m pip install pygame” in and hit enter. Then the pygame module could be automatically downloaded into the home directory. If that does not work, user can download with the link http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml. 

After finished the preceding steps, user should open the PyCharm and load the “Final_project” file into the directory of project (do not miss any wav or mp3). Then, user need to check if there are any red wavy lines on the screen (especially on the first line so that user can know whether the pygame module is installed successfully). At last, click the green triangle to run the code and enjoy the snake game.
